Description: Shiny is an R package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy
  to build interactive web applications with R.  Behind the scenes, Shiny
  builds a reactive graph that can quickly become intertwined and difficult to
  debug. 'reactlog' provides a visual insight into that black box of Shiny
  reactivity by constructing a directed dependency graph of the Shiny's
  reactive state at any time point in a reactive recording.
