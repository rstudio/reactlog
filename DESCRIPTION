Description: 'shiny' is an R package from RStudio that makes it incredibly
  easy to build interactive web applications with R. The complexity of the
  reactive elements within a 'shiny' application can quickly become
  intertwined and are difficult to debug. 'reactlog' provides a visual insight
  into the black box of 'shiny' reactivity. After logging the reactive
  interactions of a 'shiny' application, 'reactlog' constructs a directed
  dependency graph of the application's reactive state at any time point in the
  record.
