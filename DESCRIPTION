Description: Building interactive web applications with R is incredibly easy
  with 'shiny'. Behind the scenes, 'shiny' builds a reactive graph that can
  quickly become intertwined and difficult to debug. 'reactlog' 
  (Schloerke 2019) <doi:10.5281/zenodo.2591517> provides a visual insight into
  that black box of 'shiny' reactivity by constructing a directed dependency
  graph of the application's reactive state at any time point in a reactive
  recording.
