#' Reactive Log Visualizer
#'
#' Provides an interactive browser-based tool for visualizing reactive
#' dependencies and execution in your application.
#'
#' To use the reactive log visualizer, start with a fresh R session and
#' run the command \code{options(shiny.reactlog=TRUE)}; then launch your
#' application in the usual way (e.g. using \code{\link[shiny]{runApp}}). At
#' any time you can hit Ctrl+F3 (or for Mac users, Command+F3) in your
#' web browser to launch the reactive log visualization.
#'
#' The reactive log visualization only includes reactive activity up
#' until the time the report was loaded. If you want to see more recent
#' activity, refresh the browser.
#'
#' Note that Shiny does not distinguish between reactive dependencies
#' that "belong" to one Shiny user session versus another, so the
#' visualization will include all reactive activity that has taken place
#' in the process, not just for a particular application or session.
#'
#' As an alternative to pressing Ctrl/Command+F3--for example, if you
#' are using reactives outside of the context of a Shiny
#' application--you can run the \code{showReactLog} function, which will
#' generate the reactive log visualization as a static HTML file and
#' launch it in your default browser. In this case, refreshing your
#' browser will not load new activity into the report; you will need to
#' call \code{showReactLog()} explicitly.
#'
#' For security and performance reasons, do not enable
#' \code{shiny.reactlog} in production environments. When the option is
#' enabled, it's possible for any user of your app to see at least some
#' of the source code of your reactive expressions and observers.
#'
#' @param log Log produced by shiny to be processed
#' @param time A boolean that specifies whether or not to display the
#' time that each reactive.
